;;; Commentary:

;; A richer front-end for KeePass databases on top of `keepassxc-cli',
;; picked with `consult' (works with `vertico') and acted on with `embark'
;; (`embark-consult' provides preview and `embark-act' provides the action
;; menu for the entry under point).
;;
;; This is deliberately separate from `keepass-auth-source', which feeds
;; credentials to `auth-source'.  This package is for *using and editing* a
;; database interactively: list entries with the fields you care about,
;; select one, copy/insert its username, password, URL, notes or TOTP, and
;; view, add, clone, edit or delete entries.
;;
;; Only the five standard KeePass fields (Title, UserName, Password, URL,
;; Notes) plus TOTP are handled, matching what `keepassxc-cli' reliably
;; exposes.  Custom attributes are not yet supported (keepassxc-cli cannot
;; yet create them).
;;
;; Two entry points:
;;   - `keepass-browse'            pick an entry through the minibuffer
;;     (consult/vertico), then act on it (RET and `C-.' both lead to the
;;     action menu)
;;   - `keepass-browse-buffer'     a columned listing buffer (Embark works
;;     on the entry at point)
;;
;; The same actions are available from the Embark action maps
;; (`keepass-browse-action-map' and `keepass-browse-select-action-map') and
;; as interactive commands.
;;
;; This package builds on `keepass-auth-source' (same package): the shared
;; keepassxc-cli execution, master-password prompting/caching, error
;; reporting and the `keepass-auth-source-verbose' flag live there.
